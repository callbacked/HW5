Homework 4 
------------------------------------
This folder contains my code for the implementation of HW4. So far I have been able to
complete the foundation of the one line version of scrabble (Dragging tiles, having a functional board that 
locks the tiles into place, a basic scoring system, a new round and reset button, etc), but I am missing game logic
such as checking a dictionary if its a valid word, and the double word/letter score game logic.



Due to having multiple finals this upcoming week, this will be as far as I will take my implementation, I really hope
you can understand and if it weren't for that I would definitely do the extra implementation in the PDF.


Thank you for a wonderful semester, and I hope to see you in the spring for GUI 2! :)

Enjoy your winter break
